        <p>For as long as we have known Witches have been catergorised as evil, sorcerous, old, female, full of worts and vile. But what if I was to tell you this isnt true? What would you think? What if I was to tell you that Witches are good and masters of their own destiny? And still out there in the modern day world? I know I may sound like a conspiracy theorist, but hear me out. The link above talks about a modern day witch who has books about her craft and an army of other fellow witches. Witches used to be thought of as “someone who causes harm to others by mystical means.” But to this fellow witch it means “an embodiment of her truth in all its power.” But what does modern witch craft actually involve? The types of witchcraft are African witchcraft, Appalachian folk magic, Green witchcraft, Hedge Witchcraft, Hereditary witchcraft, Kitchen/Cottage witchcraft, Pennsylvania Dutch hexcraft, Traditional witchcraft and finally Wicca. To actually find out what they are all about visit <a href='https://people.howstuffworks.com/witchcraft2.htm'>THIS WEBSITE</a>. As you can tell it's a very complicated craft that is actually still practised. Weird right? I might sound like a looney, but take my word for it. And if you like do a bit of research for yourself! </p>

        <p>Like all of us we have had to deal with a change of routine and habits, that sometimes are scary. But today I would like to share with you a little about what happens on my average school day. So without further ado, here we go!</p>
        
        <p>7am = This is when I make a start to my day and wake up. I would head straight to the bathroom then do my usual bathroom rituals.</p>
        <p>7:30am = Brekky time. Usually I have good old oats, but right now I just have some toast to get me started</p>
        <p>7:50am = After I've eaten, brushed my teeth and gotten changed, I go for a walk with my doggie Benji.</p>
        <p>8:30am = From now til 2:55pm I have school plus a few breaks here and there. (Mostly involving having tea and eating!).</p>
        <p>2:55pm = Now this is my chill time and time to have a snack, finish off any homework I may have, text friends and do some hobbies.</p>
        <p>6pm = Once ive had a shower its now dinner time and time to chill on the sofa and watch some TV!</p>
